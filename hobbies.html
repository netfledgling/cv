      <li><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Learning Languages</a></li>
        <p>I enjoy learning languages. So far, I'm fluent in English, Urdu, and Hindi.
        I'm relatively confident in speaking Arabic, and I'm learning Spanish, Hebrew,
        and Korean. </p>
      <li>Baking</li>
        <p>I've always enjoyed baking. Especially due to to qurantine,
        I've been baking a lot more. Quite recently I've baked: mozzerella stuffed
        garlic bread, garlic knots, milk buns, and chocolate chip banana bread. </p>
      <li><a href="https://sanbash.wixsite.com/psychedout">Writing</a></li>
        <p>Although I haven't been writing as much lately, I do condsider it to be
        one of my strengths. I've put a link to some of my research papers that I wrote
        during my study of social psychology.</p>
